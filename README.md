# map_dilator
This repository is used to dilate map obstacles for a segway platform in ROAHM Lab, University of Michigan.

The input of this node is a map generated by Gmapping. After reading gridmap data, this ros node will try to dilate the obstacle points using opencv and publish the contour of obstacles into several topics.(pcd topics & image topics & multiarray topics)

You may run the node as:
```
rosrun map_dilator map_dilator_node
```
(This node will dilate the whole map, I suggest not using this one)

or

```
rosrun map_dilator maplocal_dilator_node
```
(This node will create a square filter(default: 6x6 m^2) around the robot and only dilate the obstacles within this sqaure)


## or more simply(you may adjust parameters in the launch file):
```
 roslaunch map_dilator maplocal_dilator.launch 
```
